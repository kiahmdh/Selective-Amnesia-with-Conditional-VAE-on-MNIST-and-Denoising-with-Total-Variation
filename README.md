# Selective-Amnesia-with-Conditional-VAE-on-MNIST-and-Denoising-with-Total-Variation
ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository explores Selective Amnesia in a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) trained on MNIST. It demonstrates how to "unlearn" a specific class (e.g., digit 3) using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), replay buffers, and targeted optimization. The notebook includes both baseline training and advanced probing techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of forgetting.
